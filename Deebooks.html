            If you haven't heard of J.K. Rowling, you live under a rock. She is one of the most popular
             writers of the past few years thanks to her Harry Potter series. But, life wasn't always 
             magical for Joanne Kathleen Rowling. She's had some tough times but she never gave up on her writing.
              The next door neighbor of Kidzworld founder Allen Achilles whose real name is Alasdair Achilles is the 
              Canadian publisher of all JK Rowling books.

    J.K.Rowling's Beginnings
Born in Chepstow, Gwent in 1965, J.K. Rowling's favorite subjects in school were English and languages. J.K.
 went to Exeter University, worked as a secretary and as a teacher, but then fell on hard times. She and her 
 husband divorced shortly after the birth of their daughter and J.K. Rowling ended up unemployed and living in
  a tiny flat in Edinburgh with her only child. Of course, maybe it wasn't all bad because it was during this 
  time that she wrote Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. The idea for the book came to J.K. Rowling while 
  on a train ride. She said that she really liked the idea of creating a place where a child could have power, like Hogwarts (School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.)

        J.K. Rowling Gets Published
Bloomsbury Publishing bought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (published in England as Harry Potter and the 
Philosopher's Stone) in 1997 and it was an instant success. Sorcerer's Stone won The British Book Awards Children's 
Book of the Year and the Smarties Prize and received rave reviews around the world. Since then there have been three
 more Harry tales - The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire and the massive Order of the Phoenix.
  J.K. Rowling has plans to write a book for each of the 7 years that Harry Potter is at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
   Warner Brothers have the rights to a lot of the books and have already made a bunch of successful flicks.

      J.K. Rowling
The first book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (1997; also published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone),
 was released under the name J.K. Rowling. (Her publisher recommended a gender-neutral pen name; born Joanne Rowling, she used J.K., adding the middle name Kathleen.)
<br>
The book was an immediate success, appealing to both children, who were its intended audience, and adults. Featuring vivid descriptions
 and an imaginative story line, it followed the adventures of the unlikely hero Harry Potter, a lonely orphan who discovers that he is actually a
  wizard and enrolls in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The book received numerous awards, including the British Book Award. Succeeding 
  volumes—Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000),
   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003), and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005)—also were best sellers, available in more than 200
    countries and some 60 languages. The seventh and final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007.
